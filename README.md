Our app aims to centralize all trackers. Simply have any device with GPS capabilities poke the app with your usename and see then all appear in one place!

## Project setup

### Website
### `Project requirements : Visual Studio and npm`

For the main app, open the `.sln` with Visual Studio and run the `track-it` project. 

In a seperate terminal, navigation to the sub-folder `ClientApp` and run `npm install` then `npm run serve`.

The project should be running on your `localhost:80`.

By default, the route `/test/seed` should be opened and will seed the database.

### Android app
Using `Android Studio`, you can open the `track-it-mobile`. The app is made for devices running Android 8 and above, so you can either use your own device or use Android Studio's emulator.
